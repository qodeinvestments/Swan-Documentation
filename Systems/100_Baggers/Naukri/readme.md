### Info Edge Limited.

Founded in 1997, started of as Naukri.com, Info Edge is has come to become a holding company today. It could be a berkshire hathaway of tech businesses in India. 
Naukri.com  started with the idea to solve the problem of Recruiters to find potential candidates and potential candidates to find good companies. They solve this problem by building a database of CVs/Resumes.

How does Naukri Make Money?

90% of Naukri's business comes from Employers(INFY,TCS,HCL etc) who are willing to pay them for accessing the vast database of Resumes.In 2023, Naukri added 20k new Resumes daily(7.3 Million/Year). *The Resumes and candidates are the Raw Material of this business. And cost of this Raw Material is the Marketing Expenditure*. Every year Naukri spends nearly 20% of Revenues on its [marketing expense](https://github.com/qodeinvestments/Swan-Documentation/assets/67407393/13e4707e-ec33-4d98-af41-bc66dff4f091)
]. And this is crucial to keep the database pool updated and growing.Having a strong marketing team and innovative campaigns are necessary to keep fueling the machine. 

What Next?

Over the years, they have cracked this model(How to get Employees to upload resumes and to get employers to buy them). Naukri is now a consistent cash cow for Info Edge (1000 Crores of Cash generated in FY23:Sitting on a 3000 Crore cash balance).

Compounding capital at a higher rates of return is a key idea in the wealth creation process. The founder understands this well and tries to redeploy whatever cash they can, in businesses they understand. The cash flow generated through Naukri is used to expand the current business as well as invest in other businesses with similar dynamics. Every Quarter they assess >1000 startups as investment opportunities.

Over the years they have stuck to Tech businesses (Within their circle of Competence). Some of the prominent businesses owned/Invested by Naukri:

i)    JeevanSathi.com  
ii)   99acres.com  
iii)  Shiksha.com  
iv)   Other Recruitment Portals( That aid the current business- Amibitionbox.com,)  
v)    Zomato  
vi)   PolicyBazaar  

Some of these investments are a pure investment play(Zomato, PB) and in some of the businesses they manage operations(99acres, Jeevansathi etc). They understood that all the cash generated cannot be redeployed in Naukri.com itself, hence the option to invest or takeover businesses with similar economics or within the same domain. 

Profitability:

All the profits of the business come from Naukri and its allied businesses. Most other verticals like 99acres,shiksha and Jeevansathi either breakeven or are loss making. All the other businesses are in different stages of their business cycle. Some of them are yet figuring out the correct business model and some have figured and its matter of time they scale up. Its hard to put an estimate as to how big they can become and how much will it contribute to future cash flows. 

What will be the big contributers to revenue going ahead?

1. Naukri's Consistent cash flow
2. Increase in app and web usage of: 99acres, Jeevansathi
3. Increase in Valuations of Zomato and PBFintech
4. Listing of any of the small startups owned/Invested by Naukri
