### Info Edge Limited.

Founded in 1997, started of as Naukri.com, Info Edge is more of a holding company today. Naukri.com started by Sanjeev Bhikchandani solves a big problem. The problem of Recruiters to find potential candidates and potential candidates to find good companies.
Today Naukri.com is the largest Job portal in India with more than 1 million jobs given and created every year.

How does Naukri Make Money?

90% of Naukri's business comes from Employers who are willing to pay them for accessing the vast database of Resumes.In 2023, Naukri added 20k new Resumes daily.As an employer this is a dream come true.But the real deal is in getting people to sign up to Naukri to put up their Resumes. The Resumes and candidates are the Raw Material of this business. And cost of this Raw Material is the Marketing Expenditure. Every year Naukri spends nearly 20% of Revenues on its marketing expense. And this is crucial to keep the database pool updated and growing.Having a strong marketing team and innovative campaigns are necessary to keep fueling the machine. 

What Next?

Over the years, they have cracked this model and Naukri is now a consistent cash cow for Info Edge.To become wealthy you need to constantly compound capital at higher rates. Compounding is necessary here. The founders have understood this well and they try and redeploy whatever cash they can in businesses they understand. Over the years they have stuck to Tech businesses (Their areas of Expertise). Over the last 25 years Info Edge, with the help of Cash flows from Naukri have Invested in:

i)    JeevanSathi.com
ii)   99acres.com
iii)  Shiksha.com
iv)   Other Recruitment Portals( That aid the current business)
v)    Zomato
vi)   PolicyBazaar

Some of these investments are a pure investment play and in some of the businesses they manage operations. They understood that all the cash generated cannot be redeployed in Naukri.com itself, hence the option to invest or takeover businesses with similar economics or within the same domain. 

Profitability:

All the profits of the business come from Naukri and its allied businesses. Most other verticals like 99acres,shiksha and Jeevansathi either breakeven or are loss making. All the other businesses are in different stages of their business cycle. Some of them are yet figuring out the correct business model and some have figured and its matter of time they scale up. Its hard to put an estimate as to how big they can become and how much will it contribute to future cash flows. But as investors thats our job, to have the vision the founder has and see the potential that others dont.
