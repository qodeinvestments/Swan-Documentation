+ Pentatonic is 30% of Revenues.
+ Pentatonic was launched as a product, but now it has become a brand itself. So the new and more expensive products will be
+ launched under this brand itself.
+ UNiball contributes to around 13-14% of Revenues. Uniball also owns 13.5% of Linc India.
+ Volume of Pens sold in FY23: 75 Crore Pens
+ Pentatonic: 2 pens: Rs.10 and Rs.20 and now launching a third Rs.40 pen
+ Major growth has been seen in Pentatonic and Uniball, so the above Rs.10 pens.

```diff
- Modular expansion of existing capacity is being done near the existing factory.
- Current basic infra has been completed to take the 20lakh pens per day. 
- Equipment and machinery will be added as and when the need comes up. Total Cost will be 50 Crores
- Phase 1: FY25: 15 Lakh pens per day. Rs.17 Crores through internal accruals
- Phase 2: FY26: Rs.15 Crores
- Of the total 75 Crore pens sold in FY23: 50% was produced inhouse and 50% outsourced.
- Now to meet the guidance and demands for FY25 they need to expand the capacity by 30Crores.
- In peak seasons the capacity falls short. Hence the capex.
- Earlier they had planned capex of 35 Crores in FY24 but now this is 17-18 Crores and the rest next year.

#### Strategy [<img align="centre" alt="Java" width="50px" src="https://github.com/qodeinvestments/Swan-Documentation/blob/main/Systems/100_Baggers/github_pages/logo_files/Strategy%20Logo%203.jpg" />][strategy]
```diff

# Linc 2.0 is the new Strategy: It is a 5 point strategy
# 1.Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10Mn kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets.
# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 3.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# FY23 Deli Sales: 25Crores will take this to 75Crores by FY25
# 4.Step up Existing Capacity to match the demand:Currently they employ 1200 female workers.
# Generally it takes 6 months to design and develop a product. Products are designed by top class engineers and designers.
# Once the product is designed they have it launched in a few markets like a test run: For 1-2 months. If it does well then full launch
# Exports: Overall exports is around $250 million a year from India.
# But this is mostly white labelling. They dont like doing a lot of White labelling.
# In exports they are focusing on the American markets: North America separately.
# Because Europe and Germany are tough markets since they have their own brands. 
# Three main ideas: 1. Make pentatonic bigger 2. Increase distribution networks
# 3. Increase the number of touchpoints
