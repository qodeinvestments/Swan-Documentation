+ Pentatonic is having a strong perceived value, hence one of the leaders in the segment
+ Pentatonic is now 30% of Revenues as against 7% in FY19
+ Due to Pentatonic the GP margins of the company have gone from 22% in FY17 to 33% today
+ Hauser(Flair) is a copy of the Pentatonic brand
+ Deli: With Deli currently main focus is the Calculator. Since there is only one big
+ player- Casio. So the goal is to get to number 2 over here.
+ And second product under Deli is the scissor.

# Linc 2.0 is the new Strategy: It is a 5 point strategy
# 1.Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10Mn kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets.
# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 3.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# Advertisement Spend: 3% of Revenues are spent on Ads. The idea is to create a brand recall, so that when the consumer
# goes to the store they should have Linc on top of their minds. For any FMCG product distribution network is the key.
# They are not very heavy or aggressive on ads- maybe because of the lower margin products
# Currently they have two displays: A 50 pen and a 100 pen display. There are some retailers who buy 50 and some 100
# Most retailers are billed monthly, some are billed every 2-3 months
# Out of the total 240,000 outlets- Deli penetration is only at 15,000 outlets
# In FY20 they had only 65,000 Stationery stores and doing sales of 320 Crores domestically, i.e 40k per store
# But this number cannot be multiplied because now Kirana stores are smaller buyers. Generally Stationey stores could purchase
# worth Rs.25,000 but kiranas could do Rs.1500-Rs.2000 every month.
# A challenge is the Stationery distributors are different from the FMCG guys. So they have to find new distributors for this
# The stationey business which is non-pens is generally lower margins since this is outsourced
# Earlier they were never targeting new retailers and kiranas, they only sold through stationey stores, but after getting a
# consulting group(Vector) they realised that they need to add more touchpoints. Only then will they grow.
# Distribution System: Buffer Penetration Replenishment: So for example if a channel partner sells 1 carton, it will trigger automatically
# in the system and will go for production. 
# Management sees themselves as a FMCG co. They want to be the colgate of pens.
