## Q1 FY24 Concall Notes:

```

Primary consumers are school students. Hence the business goes through some seasonality. Hence during Q1 because of
school holidays and vacations consumption sees a drop. 
Production is 50:50 Inhouse and outsourced just like many other FMCG manufacturers. Helps during lean periods.
Currently their main way of selling is through retailers. They keep good relations with retailers and keep giving them
good display units to keep. 
Overall they are going big on Pentatonic space. They want that to be a household name. 
Rs.10 Products contribute to 60% of Revenues. < Rs.10 is 40% of Revenues.
