```diff
- Modular expansion of existing capacity is being done near the existing factory. Current basic infra has been completed to take the 20lakh pens per day. 
- Equipment and machinery will be added as and when the need comes up. Total Cost will be 50 Crores
- Phase 1: FY25: 15 Lakh pens per day. Rs.17 Crores through internal accruals
- Phase 2: FY26: Rs.15 Crores
- Of the total 75 Crore pens sold in FY23: 50% was produced inhouse and 50% outsourced.
- Now to meet the guidance and demands for FY25 they need to expand the capacity by 30Crores. IN peak seasons the capacity falls short.
- Hence the capex. Earlier they had planned capex of 35 Crores in FY24 but now this is 17-18 Crores
