#### Strategy [<img align="centre" alt="Java" width="50px" src="https://github.com/qodeinvestments/Swan-Documentation/blob/main/Systems/100_Baggers/github_pages/logo_files/Strategy%20Logo%203.jpg" />][strategy]
```diff

# Touchpoints:
# Currently having 2.45 Lakh Touchpoints.

_________


# Linc 2.0 is the new Strategy: It is a 5 point strategy
# 1.Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10Mn kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets.
# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 3.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# FY23 Deli Sales: 25Crores will take this to 75Crores by FY25
# 4.Step up Existing Capacity to match the demand:Currently they employ 1200 female workers.
# Generally it takes 6 months to design and develop a product. Products are designed by top class engineers and designers.
# Once the product is designed they have it launched in a few markets like a test run: For 1-2 months. If it does well then full launch
# Exports: Overall exports is around $250 million a year from India.
# But this is mostly white labelling. They dont like doing a lot of White labelling.
# In exports they are focusing on the American markets: North America separately.
# Because Europe and Germany are tough markets since they have their own brands. 
# Three main ideas: 1. Make pentatonic bigger 2. Increase distribution networks
# 3. Increase the number of touchpoints

_______


# Linc 2.0 is the new Strategy: It is a 5 point strategy
# 1.Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10Mn kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets.
# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 3.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# Advertisement Spend: 3% of Revenues are spent on Ads. The idea is to create a brand recall, so that when the consumer
# goes to the store they should have Linc on top of their minds. For any FMCG product distribution network is the key.
# They are not very heavy or aggressive on ads- maybe because of the lower margin products
# Currently they have two displays: A 50 pen and a 100 pen display. There are some retailers who buy 50 and some 100
# Most retailers are billed monthly, some are billed every 2-3 months
# Out of the total 240,000 outlets- Deli penetration is only at 15,000 outlets
# In FY20 they had only 65,000 Stationery stores and doing sales of 320 Crores domestically, i.e 40k per store
# But this number cannot be multiplied because now Kirana stores are smaller buyers. Generally Stationey stores could purchase
# worth Rs.25,000 but kiranas could do Rs.1500-Rs.2000 every month.
# A challenge is the Stationery distributors are different from the FMCG guys. So they have to find new distributors for this
# The stationey business which is non-pens is generally lower margins since this is outsourced
# Earlier they were never targeting new retailers and kiranas, they only sold through stationey stores, but after getting a
# consulting group(Vector) they realised that they need to add more touchpoints. Only then will they grow.
# Distribution System: Buffer Penetration Replenishment: So for example if a channel partner sells 1 carton, it will trigger automatically
# in the system and will go for production. 
# Management sees themselves as a FMCG co. They want to be the colgate of pens.
______
# Linc 2.0: Five point strategy: 
# 1.Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10Mn kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets.
# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 4.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# Want to increase the total touchpoints to 5Lakh stores 
# the stationery and non pen category is as big as the pen category: But it will take sometime to setup and grow
________
# Increasing Touch Points: Co. increased its touch points from 5000 to 1.2 Lakh outlets from FY20 to FY23.  
________
# Increasing Touch Points: Co. increased its touch points from 5000 to 1 Lakh outlets from FY20 to FY22.Expects to reach 5 Lakh touch points by FY25.  
# Higher Margin Products: Introduction of Pentonic. No other pen company has dared to envision a pen at Rs. 10 price point without metal clip, transfer film or individual packaging. Co. is focusing on growing Pentonic more and add more products in its portfolio.
# Stationary Products: Linc is India’s exclusive importer and distributor for Deli, which is Asia's largest stationary manufacturer. It is expected that Deli business should add about Rs. 100 crores to the company's turnover in 3 to 4 years’ time.  
# Step up existing capacity Co. has an expansion plan wherein it is putting up a new manufacturing facility in the existing location at Gujarat. This will double to in-house capacity (10Lakh to 20Lakh pens per day).  
# Environmental, Social & Governance: Substituting plastic wrapper packaging with paper bulk packaging. Working on recycling of used pens.  
# Increasing distrubution network, brand awareness, new product launch : to increase market share.

Linc ltd. is primarily engaged in the manufacturing of writing instruments and sale of Pen and Refill. It generates revenue from sale of pen, refill and other stationery products. It has been in this domain from last few decades, and have been focusing on selling only pens ever since. 
  
**1. PRODUCTS:**
```diff
# Linc is India’s exclusive importer and distributor for Deli, which is Asia’s largest stationary manufacturer. The co. earlier focused on lower segment market, but it has shifted focus to Rs. 10 & above segment, starting with Pentonic in 2019.
  
# Pentonic was launched by the company in 2019, which is a ball pen and gained a lot of attention by the retail audience.
  
+ 1.1 USP of Pentonic: Minimal, Writing smoothness, Unique Design. It is a very high margin product, with GPM of 40-43% which helps in overall increase in GPM, and contributes to 25-30% of the overall revenue.
# They’ll be launching several similar products of a little higher price range (premium segment). New products will be added every year or every half year. The Co. bets that Pentonic would be a brand for at least 10-15 years.  
# It is the only distributor of the pen “Uniball” of the Japanese company Mitsubishi Pencil Co. ltd. Uniball contributes to around 13-14% of the total revenues. Uniball also owns 13.5% of Linc India. Major growth has been seen in Pentatonic and Uniball, so the above Rs.10 pens.  
# Morris Linc Private Limited (Subsidiary Co.) is a leading stationery manufacturer. It will be producing and selling the products in India and outside of India, with Linc ltd.
  
+ 1.2 Deli:
# FY23 Deli was 25 Crores and by FY25- 75 Crores estimate.  
# Other Products (Geometry Boxes, Wooden Pencils, Erasers, Sharpeners, etc.): These just contribute to 5% of sales.  
# It is expected that Deli business should add about Rs. 100 crores to the company's turnover in 3 to 4 years’ time.  
# Out of the total 240,000 outlets- Deli penetration is only at 15,000 outlets.

# Currently their main way of selling is through retailers. They keep good relations with retailers and keep giving them good display units to keep. Rs.10 Products contribute to 60% of Revenues. < Rs.10 is 40% of Revenues.

```

**2. EXPORTS:**
```
•	Q1 FY24 : Export : 16% of revenue  
•	Q4 FY23 : Export : 20% of revenue  
•	Q2 FY23 : Export : 22% of revenue  
Currently exporting to 40-50 Countries: Africa, Middle East, Russia, Brazil, North America.  
Currently advertising is 3% of Sales. And Ads are run using print media, social media campaigns and few outdoor cities.  
But not running any TV campaigns because they do not have the budget. Since margins are thin in this business.  
Gross profit margin is highly affected by Crude & Polymer prices (RAW Material Cost is directly proportional to Crude & Polymer Prices).  
```

**3. EXPANSION PLANS:**
```
Modular expansion of existing capacity is being done near the existing factory. Current basic infra has been completed to take the 20lakh pens per day (doubling it).   
Equipment and machinery will be added as and when the need comes up. Total Cost will be 50 Crores.  
Phase 1 (FY25): 15 Lakh pens per day. Rs.17 Crores through internal accruals  
Phase 2 (FY26): Rs.15 Crores  
Of the total 75 Crore pens sold in FY23: 50% was produced in-house and 50% outsourced. Now to meet the guidance and demands for FY25 they need to expand the capacity by 30Crores. In peak seasons the capacity falls short, hence the capex. Earlier they had planned capex of 35 Crores in FY24 but now this is 17-18 Crores and the rest next year.  
Linc Ltd. is now a debt free company.  

3.1 Linc 2.0 is the new strategy; it is a 5 point strategy:  
1. Touchpoints: Increase touchpoints. India has 10 million kirana outlets. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets & aiming to take this number to 5L by FY25.  
2. Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24.  
3. Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads. FY23 Deli Sales: 25Crores will take this to 75Crores by FY25.  
4. Step up Existing Capacity to match the demand: Currently they employ 1200 female workers.  
Generally it takes 6 months to design and develop a product. Products are designed by top class engineers and designers. Once the product is designed they have it launched in a few markets like a test run: For 1-2 months. If it does well then full launch.  

3.2 Three main ideas:  
1. Make pentatonic bigger  
2. Increase distribution networks  
3. Increase the number of touchpoints  
In FY20 they had only 65,000 Stationery stores and doing sales of 320 Crores domestically, i.e. 40k per store  
But this number cannot be multiplied because now Kirana stores are smaller buyers. Generally Stationery stores could purchase worth Rs.25,000 but kiranas could do Rs.1500-Rs.2000 every month.  
A challenge is the Stationery distributors are different from the FMCG guys. So they have to find new distributors for this. The stationery business which is non-pens is generally lower margins since this is outsourced
Earlier they were never targeting new retailers and kiranas, they only sold through stationery stores, but after getting a consulting group (Vector) they realized that they need to add more touchpoints. Only then will they grow.  
Management sees them as a FMCG co. They want to be the Colgate of pens.  

```

**4. INDUSTRY:**  
```
Market Share of Linc Ltd: 8% in the pen segment.  
Pens market to grow at 7-8% p.a.  
Worldwide Uniball sales are around 5000 Crores (Sold by Mitsubishi Japan Co.): This shows that Linc has big headroom over here.  
Industry is fragmented: It has a low entry barrier.  
Main players are:   
1. Cello   
2. Flair (About to get listed)   
3. Reynolds   
4. Rorito   
```

**5. GROWTH:**  
```
It is expecting to get the following results:  
FY24:  
Revenue: 600-625 Crores  
EBITDA Margins: 13-14%  
FY25:   
Revenue: 750 Crores  
Pentatonic: 40% of Revenue  
EBITDA Margin: 15%  
ROI: 21%  
Deli: 75 Crores Revenue  
```

**6. CONCLUSION:**  

```
All the guidance is based on the growth in pentatonic. The management is very bullish on pentatonic sales and hence the numbers.  
The co. is trying to leverage the existing network, to distribute stationary products other than pens.  
Starting with stationary products of Deli, will make them understand the stationary products, may start their own manufacturing of any stationary category they feel has great potential.  
Since the co. is targeting Kiranas to sell pens, alongside the stationeries, it is the only company to do so.  
It is aiming on increasing its market share from 8% to at least 20%.  
Their vision is that Pentonic is going to be the largest single pen brand. Overall they are going big on pentatonic space. They want that to be a household name.
```
```
In conclusion, our analysis highlights the company's remarkable strengths, including diversified revenue streams, successful product innovations, and a clear growth strategy.  
However, challenges such as margin pressures and effective strategy execution warrant attention. By leveraging its strengths and addressing areas of concern, the company can continue its journey towards sustainable success in the dynamic writing instrument industry.
