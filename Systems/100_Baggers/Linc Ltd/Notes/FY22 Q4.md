# Trying to leverage the existing network, to distribute stationary products other than pens.
# Starting with stationary products of Deli, will make them understand the stationary products.
# May start their own manufacturing of any stationary category they feel has great potential.
# Will be increasing the touchpoints, through non-stationary outlets like Kiranas. Stationary Outlets are estimated to be about 2 lakh, while Kirana stores are more than 1Cr.
# 45% of the pens are sold from non-stationary outlets, which is in favout of them as there is not any extra cost to access the non-stationary outlet for the existing distributors servicing stationary.
# This is the only company to target Kirana stores.
# Aiming on increasing the company's market share from 8% to atleast 20%. 
# Pentonic is going to be the larget single pen brand.
