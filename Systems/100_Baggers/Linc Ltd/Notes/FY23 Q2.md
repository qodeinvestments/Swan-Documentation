# Will take this number to 5L by FY25.
# 2.Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24
# 4.Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads.
# Want to increase the total touchpoints to 5Lakh stores 
# the stationery and non pen category is as big as the pen category: But it will take sometime to setup and grow
