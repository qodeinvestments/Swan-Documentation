Linc ltd. is primarily engaged in the manufacturing of writing instruments and sale of Pen and Refill. It generates revenue from sale of pen, refill and other stationery products. It has been in this domain from last few decades, and have been focusing on selling only pens ever since. Mostly operating in two categories : Rs.5 and Rs.10 Ball and gel pens. Most of the Rs.5 pens
are operated under the Linc Brand and the Rs.10 under the pentatonic brand.  
  
The business is fairly simple to understand. They sell through 250,000 touch points across the country. These touchpoints are the key part of the business. Without this there are no sales. Year after year they focus on increasing the number of touchpoints(distributors). They plan to take this number to 500k by 2025.

<h2> 1. PRODUCTS</h2> 
Linc has mainly 4 Products :  
  
1) [Pentonic](https://lincpen.com/product/pen/pentonic) 
2) [Uniball](https://lincpen.com/blog-details/the-untold-story-of-mitsubishi-and-its-flagship-brand-of-uni-ball)  
3) [Deli](https://lincpen.com/blog-details/top-5-smart-best-deli-calculators-for-every-desktop)
4) [Other Linc products](https://lincpen.com/products)  
  
The co. earlier focused on lower segment market, but it has shifted focus to Rs. 10 & above segment, starting with Pentonic in 2019.   
Pentonic was launched by the company in 2019, which is a ball pen and gained a lot of attention by the retail audience.
  
<h4>1.1 Pentonic:</h4>
USP of Pentonic: Minimal, Writing smoothness, Unique Design. It is a very high margin product, with GPM of 40-43% which helps in overall increase in GPM, and contributes to 25-30% of the overall revenue.  
  
See the Revenue contribution of Pentonic [here.]()
  
They’ll be launching several similar products of a little higher price range (premium segment). New products will be added every year or every half year. The Co. bets that Pentonic would be a brand for at least 10-15 years.

<h4>1.2 Uni-Ball:</h4>  
  
It is the only distributor of the pen “Uniball” of the Japanese company Mitsubishi Pencil Co. ltd. Uniball contributes to around 13-14% of the total revenues. Uniball also owns 13.5% of Linc India. Major growth has been seen in Pentatonic and Uniball, so the above Rs.10 pens.

<h4>1.3 Deli:</h4>
  
Linc is India’s exclusive importer and distributor for Deli, which is Asia’s largest stationary manufacturer.  
FY23 Deli did revenue of 25 Crores and by FY25 it is expecting to do 75 Crores.  
Other products include (Geometry Boxes, Wooden Pencils, Erasers, Sharpeners, etc.): These just contribute to 5% of sales.It is expected that Deli business should add about Rs. 100 crores to the company's turnover in 3 to 4 years’ time.  
Out of the total 240,000 outlets- Deli penetration is only at 15,000 outlets.  

<h4>1.4 Other Linc Products:</h4>
  
Linc also has several other products of its own like pens, sanitizers,etc which do not have a very high margin.  
Morris Linc Private Limited (Subsidiary Co.) is a leading stationery manufacturer. It will be producing and selling the products in India and outside of India, with Linc ltd.  

Generally it takes 6 months to design and develop a product. Products are designed by top class engineers and designers. Once the product is designed they have it launched in a few markets like a test run: For 1-2 months. If it does well then full launch.


<h2> 2. EXPORT & SALES: </h2> 
  
Primary consumers are school students. Hence the business goes through some seasonality. Hence during Q1 because of school holidays and vacations consumption sees a drop.  
Production is 50:50 In-house and outsourced just like many other FMCG manufacturers. Helps during lean periods.  
Currently their main way of selling is through retailers. They keep good relations with retailers and keep giving them good display units to keep. Rs.10 Products contribute to 60% of Revenues. < Rs.10 is 40% of Revenues.

Currently exporting to 40-50 Countries: Africa, Middle East, Russia, Brazil, North America.  
Currently advertising is 3% of Sales. And Ads are run using print media, social media campaigns and few outdoor cities.  
But not running any TV campaigns because they do not have the budget. Since margins are thin in this business.  
Gross profit margin is highly affected by Crude & Polymer prices (RAW Material Cost is directly proportional to Crude & Polymer Prices).  
And is now a debt free company.  

<h2> 3. EXPANSION PLANS: </h2> 
  
Modular expansion of existing capacity is being done near the existing factory. Current basic infra has been completed to take the 20lakh pens per day (doubling it).   
  
Equipment and machinery will be added as and when the need comes up. Total Cost will be 50 Crores:  
**Phase 1 (FY25):** 15 Lakh pens per day. Rs.17 Crores through internal accruals  
**Phase 2 (FY26):** Rs.15 Crores  
  
Of the total 75 Crore pens sold in FY23: 50% was produced in-house and 50% outsourced. Now to meet the guidance and demands for FY25 they need to expand the capacity by 30Crores. In peak seasons the capacity falls short, hence the capex. Earlier they had planned capex of 35 Crores in FY24 but now this is 17-18 Crores and the rest next year.  
  
<h4>3.1 Linc 2.0 is the new strategy; 5 point strategy:</h4>
  
1. Touchpoints:
   
   Increase touchpoints. Currently Linc has reached 2.4L outlets & aiming to take this number to 5L by FY25. It has been growing its touchpoints consistently from a long time. It has decided to target Kiranas stores now to sell their pens. India has 10 million kirana outlets (which will be the target for touchpoints now). No one has ever targeted the kirana segment to sell pens except them.

2. Focus on higher margin products. Most developments under the pentatonic portfolio: 3 products to be launch in FY24. See the PAT margin change YoY [here.]()
3. Stationery Products: Using the Deli brand, they will make bigger inroads. FY23 Deli Sales: 25Crores will take this to 75Crores by FY25.
4. Step up Existing Capacity to match the demand: Currently they employ 1200 female workers.


<h4>3.2 Three main ideas: </h4>

1. Make pentatonic bigger 
2. Increase distribution networks
3. Increase the number of touchpoints

In FY20 they had only 65,000 Stationery stores and doing sales of 320 Crores domestically, i.e. 40k per store.  
But this number cannot be multiplied because now Kirana stores are smaller buyers. Generally Stationery stores could purchase worth Rs.25,000 but kiranas could do Rs.1500-Rs.2000 every month.  
A challenge is the Stationery distributors are different from the FMCG guys. So they have to find new distributors for this. The stationery business which is non-pens is generally lower margins since this is outsourced.  
  
Earlier they were never targeting new retailers and kiranas, they only sold through stationery stores, but after getting a consulting group (Vector) they realized that they need to add more touchpoints. Only then will they grow.  
  
Management sees them as a FMCG co. They want to be the Colgate of pens.  

<h2> 4. INDUSTRY: </h2> 
  
- Market Share of Linc Ltd: 8% in the pen segment.  
- Pens market to grow at 7-8% p.a.   
- Worldwide Uniball sales are around 5000 Crores (Sold by Mitsubishi Japan Co.): This shows that Linc has big headroom over here.  
- Industry is fragmented: It has a low entry barrier.  

Main players are: 
1. Cello 
2. Flair (About to get listed) 
3. Reynolds 
4. Rorito

<h2> 5. FUTURE GROWTH: </h2> 

It is expecting to get the following results:  
**FY24:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue: 600-625 Crores  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EBITDA Margins: 13-14%  
**FY25:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue: 750 Crores  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pentatonic: 40% of Revenue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EBITDA Margin: 15%  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROI: 21%  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deli: 75 Crores Revenue  

All the guidance is based on the growth in pentatonic. The management is very bullish on pentatonic sales and hence the numbers.  
The co. is trying to leverage the existing network, to distribute stationary products other than pens.  
Starting with stationary products of Deli, will make them understand the stationary products, may start their own manufacturing of any stationary category they feel has great potential.  
  
Since the co. is targeting Kiranas to sell pens, alongside the stationeries, it is the only company to do so.  
It is aiming on increasing its market share from 8% to at least 20%.  
  
**Their vision is that Pentonic is going to be the largest single pen brand. Overall they are going big on pentatonic space. They want that to be a household name.   **

In conclusion, our analysis highlights the company's remarkable strengths, including diversified revenue streams, successful product innovations, and a clear growth strategy.
However, challenges such as margin pressures and effective strategy execution need attention.
