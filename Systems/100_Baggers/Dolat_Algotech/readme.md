Dolat Algotech is in the business of Prop trading. Trading Futures and Options on the National Stock Exchange. It employees Quant Analysts, Engineers, Software Developers to run operations.  
They want to make trading a science.Software used by them is made inhouse,Strategies are made inhouse. They primarily run hedged Delta neutral strategies, having no black swan event risk. 
Hence risk of Losing Capital is negligible. Dolat as a group has been in the stock market business as brokers/traders for a very long time( >30 years). They have a few group cos doing similar
activities too. From 2017 results have been brilliant. 

### Business:

They are primarily into trading. Almost all of its profits come from Trading F&O. Since we are in the same business we understand how difficult it is to make money consistently becuase of the elements of
i) Curve Fitting ii) Mispricings fading away due to many participants. Inspite of this, these guys have had a great track record. No Loss making month since inception. 2017 to 2023 They have generated 35-40% ROCE 
on an average. Each Quarter has been profitable. The high ROCE is a factor of having access to a Bank Guarantee at a low cost of 1%p.a. So essentially they are making 18-20% on their trading books and have 
levered up 2x. Leverage is key for a High ROCE. But its important to key risks in check when you lever your book 2x. 


#### What Stands Out?

Over the years we've come across 50-100 Traders and very few have been able to be consistently profitable. Consistently making money means you know something others dont. 
We know that individual traders cannot have such track records. Its only possible if you have a good team. So they have definetely have built a team and culture to acheive this. 
We do not know much other than the fine track record and team. We have seen their job postings on their website and Naukri. 


#### What leads to such high Returns?

i)  Low Drawdown hedged systems
ii) 2x Leverage: Bank Guarantee

#### What risks do we see?

i) SEBI is actively disuading people to trade F&O: Why do we think so ? 
    - Higher STT
    - Higher Taxes on F&O
    - Writing Reports as to how F&O traders dont make money with stats
    - Promoting Mutual Funds

ii)  If BG's are no longer accepted with the exchange: This will be a game changer, returns will fall to half of what it is ( Looking at the way SEBI is moving, this is very much on the table)
iii) Issues with Scaling: There is a limitation of Volumes and scale in this game
iv)  Trading Businesses do not get crazy multiples because of low entry bareers in the business. All you need is capital to start the business.
