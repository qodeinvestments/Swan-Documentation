# PSAR Index Options

The PSAR indicator forms a parabola composed of small dots that are either above or below the trading price. When the parabola is below the stock price, it acts as a support and trail-stop area, while indicating bullish up trending price action. When the stock price falls below a single dot, then a stop-loss/sell /sell-short trigger forms.
The parabolic indicator generates buy or sell signals when the position of the dots moves from one side of the asset's price to the other.

- If PSAR is ABOVE underlying price, we go short on the ATM CALL option and if PSAR is BELOW underlying price, we go short on the ATM PUT option.
- This Backtest was initially performed on equity.
