# PSAR
The parabolic indicator generates buy or sell signals when the position of the dots moves from one side of the asset's price to the other. For example, a buy signal occurs when the dots move from above the price to below the price, while a sell signal occurs when the dots move from below the price to above the price.

The PSAR indicator forms a parabola composed of small dots that are either above or below the trading price. When the parabola is below the stock price, it acts as a support and trail-stop area, while indicating bullish up trending price action. When the stock price falls below a single dot, then a stop-loss/sell /sell-short trigger forms.
