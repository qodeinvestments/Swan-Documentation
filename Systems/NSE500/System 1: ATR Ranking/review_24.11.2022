NSE500 ATRRanking Review:

Introduction:-

This is the review for the NSE500 ATRRanking System.The purpose for this review is that we want to compare the Live results with the Backtest
Results. A system like NSE500 has a lot of moving parts due to which there can be several discrepancies between the Live and Backtest results,therefore the
review of such a system is necessary.Following process has been adopted for the review.

Process: - 
1) We have the live trade list from the SOS PropBook on DropBox. We also have a folder named "KavanRanking" on DropBox which has all the rankings 
for that system. The date on the ranking sheets is a day prior to the Actual Trade date,For eg: if the sheet is named "Ranking Exploration Kavan01.02.2022", 
it means that the trades will be executed on "02.02.2022".Trades that have been analyzed are from 13-01-2022 to 24-11-2022.The slippage numbers taken in the 
backtest are same which have been invcurred in live.

2) We also have the Backtest Trades and Backtest Ranking for the same period.The manner in which the Backtest Ranking Composite symbols are generated and the 
way in which the Backtest has been done has been throughly explained in the NSE500 System Documentation.

3)Live trades have been compared with Backtest Trades.There are two checks that we've had in place. Firstly, we check if the number of trades placed in both 
in Live and Backtest are the same. Secondly, we also check if the stocks traded match with the Backtested trades everyday.

4)As seen, there has been a lot of difference in the stocks placed everyday.Since 13-01-2022, around than 60% of the trades have matched.
This is because there are certain stocks, though they come in the backtest, are not allowed to be traded live. Therefore there has been a massive difference 
between the two results.

5)We created an afl named "NSE500 excludeok" which consists of the name of stocks which we are not able to trade live.This list is has been made from 02-03-2022.  
We've re-created the Ranking and the Backtest after incorporating the Excludeok list and then re-done the analysis.

6)The New Backtested trades are then compared with the Live trades.The number of trades matching the Live trades are now around 86%.We checked for the deviation in 
the ranks by comparing the Live Ranks for each stock and their corresponding Backtested ranks. The deviations have not been a lot.

7) We have also done a backtets from "01-01-2013 to 24-11-2013". This backtest doesn't include the "NSE500 ExcludeOk" code as we dont have data on stocks
which were excluded from trading on a day to day basis from 2013 onwards. As seen in the backtest, 2022 has not been particularly a great year for the "ATR Ranking"
system. Nevertheless its been positive and similarly average performances were seen in a couple of earlier years. The ATRRanking System generally trades stocks 
which are a lot more volatile. Stocks that are banned from trading on any given day are the stocks which are volatile. This system breeds on volatility, so by not 
getting an opportunity to trade such stocks, the live returns we get may never match the backtested returns unless the Historical Backtest is been done with the 
Excludeok code which unfortunately we don not have.The last step we will adopt is to do a trend analysis with and without the "NSE500 ExcludeOk" code to see how stocks
have moved Intraday from 10-05-2022 to 24-11-2022. 

Conclusion: - The ATRRanking System generally trades stocks which are a lot more volatile. Stocks that are banned from trading on any given day are the stocks 
which are volatile. This system breeds on volatility, so by not getting an opportunity to trade such stocks, the live returns we get may never match the backtested 
returns unless the Historical Backtest is been done with the Excludeok code which unfortunately we don not have. As the stocks which are banned from trading may differ
from broker to broker, it might be worthwhile to trade this sytem with another broker.
